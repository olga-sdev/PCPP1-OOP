'''
Classes, Instances, Attributes, Methods â€” the LAB

Objectives
creating classes, methods, and variables;
calling methods;
getting simple access to instance variables;

Scenario
create a class representing a mobile phone;
your class should implement the following methods:
__init__ expects a number to be passed as an argument; this method stores the number in an instance variable self.number
turn_on() should return the message 'mobile phone {number} is turned on'. Curly brackets are used to mark the place to insert the object's number variable;
turn_off() should return the message 'mobile phone is turned off';
call(number) should return the message 'calling {number}'. Curly brackets are used to mark the place to insert the object's number variable;
create two objects representing two different mobile phones; assign any random phone numbers to them;
implement a sequence of method calls on the objects to turn them on, call any number. Print the methods' outcomes;
turn off both mobiles.
Example output

mobile phone 01632-960004 is turned on
mobile phone 01632-960012 is turned on
calling 555-34343
mobile phone is turned off
mobile phone is turned off

# Call method
samsung.turn_on()
