Inheriting properties from built-in classes
Python gives you the ability to create a class that inherits properties from any Python built-in class in order to get
a new class that can enrich the parent's attributes or methods.
As a result, your newly-created class has the advantage of all of the well-known functionalities inherited from its
parent or even parents and you can still access those attributes and methods.
