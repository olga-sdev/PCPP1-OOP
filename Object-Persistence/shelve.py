"""
Shelve module implements a serialization dictionary where objects are pickled and associated with a key:
* the keys must be strings;
* to enforce an immediate flush, call the sync() method on your shelve object;
* when you call the close() method on an shelve object, it also flushes the buffers.

When you treat a shelve object like a Python dictionary, you can make use of the dictionary utilities:
the len() function;
the in operator;
the keys() and items() methods;
the update operation, which works the same as when applied to a Python dictionary;
the del instruction, used to delete a key-value pair.


The meaning of the optional flag parameter:
