"""
Metaprogramming is a technique in which computer programs have the ability to modify their own or other programsâ€™ codes.

n many cases metaprogramming allows programmers to minimize the number of lines of code to express a solution,
in turn reducing development time.

But the truth is that this technique could be used for tool preparation; those tools could be applied to your code
to make it follow specific programming patterns, or to help you create a coherent API.

Another example of metaprogramming is the metaclass concept,
which is one of the most advanced concepts presented in this course.

metaclasses redirect class instantiations to dedicated logic, contained in metaclasses.
Metaclasses are applied when class definitions are read to create classes, well before classes are instantiated.

The typical use cases for metaclasses:

* logging;
* registering classes at creation time;
* interface checking;
* automatically adding new methods;
* automatically adding new variables.
